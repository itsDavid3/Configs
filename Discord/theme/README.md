# Comfy++
This is a fork of "[Comfy](https://github.com/Comfy-Themes/Discord)" by [Nyria](https://github.com/NYRI4) made to fix some issues that the original theme had.
<br>
I've also added and changed some stuff in a way that I think looks better.


## ðŸ“¥ Installation
* Discord Settings > Themes > Online Themes > paste <code>https://raw.githubusercontent.com/itsDavid3/Configs/main/Discord/theme/comfy.theme.css</code> into the box
* Or put "comfy.theme.css" in Discord Settings > Themes > Local Themes > Open Themes Folder



## ðŸ“ƒ Customization
In the file "comfy.theme.css" you have many options that you can customize and make the theme look the way you like it.
<br>
The options are : 
* Hidable Scrollbars
* Better SpotifyControls seek bar
* Better User Buttons
* Animations:
    * To disable all animations you'll have edit "UserButtons.css"
* Hidable Message Box
* Avatar/status/servers Roundness
* Colors:
    * Server/channel list
    * Mention in chat
    * Chat buttons
    * SpotifyControls seek bar
    * Status
    * User popout
    * Dark Theme (Light Theme not supported)
* Hidable Discord logo
