# Comfy++
This is a fork of "[Comfy](https://github.com/Comfy-Themes/Discord)" by [Nyria](https://github.com/NYRI4) made to fix some issues that the original theme had.
<br>
I've also added and changed some stuff in a way that I think looks better.
<br>
I use exclusively the dark theme so light theme is not fully supported, but in my very limited testing I think it works fine.

⚠️ - Hidden notes box, the permissions tab under the roles, and folder icons is because of a plugin NOT THEME.
