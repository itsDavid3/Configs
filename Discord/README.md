# Comfy++
This is a fork of "[Comfy](https://github.com/Comfy-Themes/Discord)" by [Nyria](https://github.com/NYRI4) made to fix some issues that the original theme had.
<br>
I've also added and changed some stuff in a way that I think looks better.


## üì• Installation
* Discord Settings > Themes > Online Themes > paste `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/itsDavid3/Configs/main/Discord/theme/comfy.theme.css` into the box
* Or put "comfy.theme.css" in Discord Settings > Themes > Local Themes > Open Themes Folder


## üñåÔ∏è Vencord
Below is a table of every plugin I use. <br>
For css snippets check out the "css-snippets.css" file.

| BetterGifAltText | CallTimer | CopyUserURLs | FavoriteEmojiFirst | ShikiCodeblocks |

## üìÉ Customization
In the file "comfy.theme.css" you have many options that you can customize and make the theme look the way you like it.
<br>
The options are : 
* Hidable Scrollbars

    * To disable all animations you'll have edit "UserButtons.css"

    * Server/channel list
    * Mention in chat
    * Chat buttons

‚ö†Ô∏è - Hidden notes box and the permissions tab under the roles is because of a plugin NOT THEME.
